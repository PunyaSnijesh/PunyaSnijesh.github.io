					          	<span class="category mb-1 d-block"><a href="#">Abstract</a></span>

				              <p class="mb-4">Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have significantly expanded clinical genetic 
testing for inherited conditions and diseases like cancer, with accurate variant calling being a 
crucial step that underpins downstream analysis and interpretation. The software tools and 
approaches for detecting sequence variants in clinical samples have evolved significantly, much 
like NGS technologies, in the last decade. Variant calling is a crucial step in analyzing NGS data, 
as it enables the identification of genomic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs), insertions and deletions.</p><p>
The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a widely used software suite that provides a range of 
tools for variant calling from NGS data. GATK uses a probabilistic model to identify variants while 
accounting for sequencing errors, mapping errors, and other sources of noise. The GATK workflow 
for variant calling typically involves several preprocessing steps, including mapping the reads to 
a reference genome, marking duplicate reads, and recalibrating the base quality scores. These 
preprocessing steps help improve the accuracy of variant calling.</p><p>
The core variant calling algorithm in GATK is called HaplotypeCaller, which uses local de novo 
assembly to identify haplotypes (i.e., sets of closely linked variants) in the reads. HaplotypeCaller 
then uses these haplotypes to improve the accuracy of variant calling, particularly for regions of 
the genome with complex variants, such as indels. GATK also provides other variant calling tools, 
including UnifiedGenotyper and MuTect, which are optimized for different types of NGS data and 
variant calling applications.</p><p>
After variant calling, the resulting variant call format (VCF) file can be further processed and 
filtered using GATK tools, such as VariantFiltration, to remove low-quality variants and reduce 
false positives. GATK also provides tools for variant annotation, such as VariantAnnotator and 
SnpEff, which can provide additional information about the functional effects of variants, 
including their effects on genes and proteins. Overall, GATK provides a powerful and flexible 
toolkit for variant calling from NGS data. However, effective use of GATK requires expertise in 
bioinformatics and careful attention to quality control and filtering to minimize false positives and 
ensure the accuracy of variant calls. Nonetheless, GATK's popularity and wide adoption in the 
scientific community attest to its usefulness and effectiveness for variant calling from NGS data.

 	<span class="category mb-1 d-block"><a href="#">Introduction</a></span>
	<p class="mb-4">Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the field of genomics since its introduction 
over a decade ago. It represents a high-throughput and cost-effective method for sequencing DNA 
and RNA, allowing researchers to decode and analyze genetic information on a scale not 
previously achievable1
. The growth of NGS technology has been remarkable, driving significant 
advancements in various fields and contributing to numerous scientific breakthroughs and medical 
discoveries. NGS has found numerous applications across different areas of research and 
medicine2–6
. In the field of genomics, it has facilitated large-scale projects such as the Human 
Genome Project, which aimed to sequence the entire human genome7,8. NGS has enabled the 
exploration of genomic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, 
deletions, and structural variations, which play critical roles in understanding genetic diseases and 
population genetics.
In the field of clinical diagnostics, NGS has transformed genetic testing by enabling 
comprehensive and rapid analysis of patient samples. It has become a valuable tool for diagnosing 
genetic disorders, identifying disease-causing mutations, and guiding treatment decisions. NGS￾based tests are now routinely used for carrier screening, prenatal testing, newborn screening, and 
oncology diagnostics. Beyond genomics, NGS has extended its applications to other areas of 
research, such as transcriptomics and epigenetics9,10. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) allows the 
quantification and profiling of gene expression, leading to a deeper understanding of cellular 
functions, developmental processes, and disease mechanisms11–13. Epigenetic modifications, such 
as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can also be analyzed using NGS techniques, 
providing insights into gene regulation and epigenetic alterations associated with diseases14
.
The growth of NGS has been fueled by continuous advancements in sequencing technologies, 
bioinformatics tools, and data analysis methods. The introduction of new platforms and 
improvements in sequencing chemistry and read lengths have enhanced the accuracy, speed, and 
cost-effectiveness of NGS. Moreover, the development of robust bioinformatics pipelines and 
computational algorithms has enabled the efficient processing and interpretation of vast amounts 
of sequencing data.
In this chapter, we discuss the current best practices for variant calling in clinical sequencing 
studies, with a particular emphasis on variant calling for inherited disorders. Variant calling is a 
fundamental step in the analysis of NGS data that involves identifying genetic variations in a 
sample relative to a reference genome. Accurate and reliable variant calling is crucial for 
understanding the genetic basis of diseases, identifying potential drug targets, and developing 
personalized therapies. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a widely used software package 
for variant calling in NGS data. Developed by the Broad Institute, GATK provides a 
comprehensive set of tools for variant discovery, genotyping, and annotation15. The software is 
highly customizable and can be tailored to specific experimental designs and sequencing 
platforms.
<h5>Requirements for running variant calling analysis</h5>
For optimal performance, it is advisable to use a computer with ample memory and processing 
capabilities. While a minimum of 8 GB of memory is necessary, a recommended range of 8 to 16 
GB is suggested when working with larger genomes like the human genome. The software is 
compatible with Unix or Unix-like systems such as Linux or MacOS X, provided Java is installed. 
Although BWA has been adapted for Windows, users have reported utilizing GATK and Picard 
tools with Cygwin; however, this usage is not officially supported. In this protocol we are using 
Ubuntu (Version 22.04) machine for the analysis. The following packages are required to be 
installed in the system to carry out the analysis.</p><p>
Anaconda: Anaconda is a widely used platform in the field of data science. It provides a 
comprehensive and user-friendly environment for data analysis, scientific computing, and machine 
learning. Its ease of use, extensive package library, and robust package management system make 
it a go to choose for many data scientists and researchers. The script to download and install 
anaconda is given below.</p>

  <span class="command">bash Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh</span>
</div></div>
Once anaconda is installed, we need to install packages like Burrows-Wheeler Alignment Tool 
(BWA), SAMtools, GATK, SnpEff, R and R libraries ggplot2 and gsalib. These tools can be 
installed within anaconda using the following commands.

			<p>The resource bundle refers to a collection of reference files and known variant datasets that are 
commonly used in genomic analysis. The GATK resource bundle is a curated set of high-quality 
reference and annotation files provided by the Broad Institute to aid researchers in their genomic 
analysis pipelines. The resource bundle includes Reference genome in FASTA format; Variant 
calling resources such as dbSNP, HapMap, and 1000 Genomes Project variants; Annotation 
resources that provide functional information about genomic elements which include information 
about gene locations, transcripts, protein-coding regions, and other genomic features; Index files 
that are necessary for efficient data retrieval and querying. These index files enable quick access 
to specific genomic regions, improving the performance of read alignment and variant calling 
algorithms. The GATK resource bundle is regularly updated and maintained by the Broad Institute 
to ensure the availability of the most up-to-date and relevant genomic references and annotations. 
Researchers can download the resource bundle and incorporate it into their analysis pipelines, 
simplifying the process of obtaining and using essential genomic data. By providing a 
comprehensive set of reference and annotation files, the GATK resource bundle streamlines the 
setup and execution of genomic analysis workflows. It ensures consistent and standardized analysis across different projects and facilitates reproducibility and comparability of results within 
the genomics community. The resource bundle available at broad repository can be accessed using 
following link <a style="font:italic; color:blue;" href="https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/genomics-public-data">https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/genomics-public-data</a>. The 
downloaded files were kept under the directory ‘bundle’.</p><P>
The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)16 and Sequence Read Archive (SRA)17 are key databases 
for storing and sharing biological data, particularly high-throughput sequencing and omics data. 
ENA serves as a comprehensive repository for nucleotide sequences, accepting data from various 
sequencing technologies and providing a platform for archiving, retrieval, and analysis. It 
encompasses not only sequence data but also metadata, annotations, and associated information. 
On the other hand, SRA, maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(NCBI)17, specializes in raw sequencing data storage and access, including short and long reads 
from next-genneration sequencing platforms. Researchers can submit their data to SRA for public 
availability, promoting data sharing and facilitating its reuse for diverse research purposes. In the 
current study, we used a trio dataset from ENA database. We used wget command to download the 
samples. The downloaded samples were kept under directory name ‘data’.</p>

<h5>Quality control</h5>
<p>Quality control (QC) involves assessing the quality of sequencing data to identify and remove low-quality reads. The goal of QC is to minimize noise and errors in the downstream analysis and 
improve the accuracy and reliability of variant calls. The first step in QC is to assess the quality of 
the raw sequencing data. This involves examining the sequencing metrics, such as read length, 
sequencing depth, and base quality scores, to identify any issues that may affect the quality of the 
data. Common quality issues include low read depth, adapters, high error rates, and base quality 
score compression. These issues can result in false-positive variant calls, which can lead to 
erroneous conclusions. The next step is to remove low-quality reads and trim adapters and low-quality bases from the sequencing data. This step is critical for improving the accuracy and 
reliability of variant calls. Several tools are available for quality control, including FastQC18
, 
Trimmomatic19, TrimGalore20,21 and Cutadapt<span class="badge">22</span>, among others. These tools help to remove low-quality reads and trim adapters and low-quality bases from the sequencing data. In this chapter, we 
will use FastQC12 for quality check and TrimGalore for removal of adapters and low-quality reads 
in the sample. The following scripts are used to run QC and removal of noise in the sample.</p>
